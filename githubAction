To create a basic GitHub Action workflow file, you can follow these steps:

Create a new directory named .github/workflows in your repository if it doesn't already exist.
Inside this directory, create a new file named ci.yml.
Populate the file with a basic GitHub Action workflow configuration.
Here's an example of a basic GitHub Action workflow file:

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  first-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Say Something
      run: echo "Hello, World"
